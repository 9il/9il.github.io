## [Atmosphere GM](http://9il.github.io/atmosphere_gm)
Statistical package.

Atmosphere GM contains an experimental algorithms for new generation of likelihood maximization methods. The goal of this library is to create a reliable and simple in use technology that can be used by software engineers. Package is growing step by step with mathematical publications.
